    <p>Gotham Zoning is an interactive map that lets you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                find out <strong>how your building is zoned</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                learn <strong>where to locate your business</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                explore <strong>zoning patterns</strong> throughout the city
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To make New York City's zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration from one of our favorite games: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It started with the color scheme: <strong style='color: #7DD67D;'>green</strong>
              for residential, <strong style='color: #7474D7;'>blue</strong>
              for commercial and <strong style='color: #DCDC7F;'>yellow</strong>
              for manufacturing. (This oversimplifies things a bit, <a href='/about#zoning-categories'>read the full story</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>From there we got a little carried away. Graphics, sounds, music, oh my.</p>
            <p>Gotham Zoning is a fork of <a href='http://secondcityzoning.org/'>2nd City Zoning</a>, a civic app built by <a href = 'http://opencityapps.org/'>Open City</a>.  Be sure to check out their great work, and consider forking this project for your city too!</p>

    <h4 id='what-is-zoning'>What is zoning?</h4>
     Zoning is the set of rules that a city comes up with to define acceptable land use in specific areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists of
          <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zonetext.shtml'>regulations</a>
          that control how big of a building you can build on a property,
          what you can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere -
          every property in New York City lives in a zoning district of one kind or another.
          
        </p>

      We are using some music and sound effects from
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000'>Sim City 2000</a>
      on this website. This is not to make a Sim City competitor, but to make the experience of diving in to zoning laws fun!

    <h4 id='data'>Data</h4>
    <p>
      This site was built with
      <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwnzdata.shtml'>zoning shapefiles</a>
      from the New York City Department of City Planning.
  
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href = 'http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/subcats/zoning.shtml'>The DCP Zoning Site</a> was also referenced for basic information and text about each type of zoning district.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We love that the City of New York has opened their data for all to use. This site represents just one example of what can be done with it. We hope it inspires others to dive in to zoning (and other) civic open datasets.
